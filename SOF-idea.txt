["Mohamadhassan Ebrahimi"]: "Installing postgresql on windows: First of all, don't make my mistake. If there is an
unworking version of postgres in your system, don't hesitate to fully remove it first. (I had installed another version
before, and reinstalled the Windows afterward...). After installing, get ready to endure some pain!!💊💊
There are some aspects to cover here. First of all, postgresql saves the "postgres" user's password in a file here in
this address: %AppData%/postgresql/pgpass.conf This password is the root password of your database. Postgres will ask
you for this password when installing postgres. (Not in my case, when I reinstalled on a pre-installed version, as it
was using previous configurations, but no file in AppData and I had no idea where I am going to find the password).
You should add postgres installation path (bin folder in PostgreSQL/<version>) to your environment variables of windows,
in order to use psql (and probably more useful commands) exactly in CMD.
I had a problem using psql command, as it used my Username as postgresql user and required password but neither my
windows password nor postgres user password worked here.
After lots of search, I found out that there is another conf file in PostgreSQL/data folder called pg_hba.conf that
handles users and how they are authenticated in postgres. There was a suggestion that you change every pre-configured
methods with 'trust' (while there were a warning in another site that this is not safe to do). I did this and after that
I had to restart postgresql service from services.msc (If you encountered "The postgresql-x64-9.6 service on local
computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or
programs.", then you had configured pg_hba.conf wrong...). Now I was able to use psql with postgres (root) user (psql -U
postgres) and do SQL, but it was not convenient (You should use -U postgres every time and yet it's not safe as it's
like doing every command with sudo privileges in linux). I did some search and finally found this useful commands:
DROP USER username; -- DROP the windows user first as you haven't its password...
CREATE ROLE username LOGIN PASSWORD 'password goes here'; -- recreate the user you've just dropped
Yet you have to create a database exactly with the name of the user...
CREATE DATABASE username;
ALTER DATABASE username OWNER TO username; -- changing database owner to username
Now you may be able to use psql without any options, but for me that was not all. My username starts with Uppercase M
and I didn't know that SQL codes within psql command are lowercased all (The names are case-sensitive but the jerk makes
them lowercased!!😒😒) Imagine... I tried to login but it said that database Mohamadhassan does not exist and when I
tried to Create it with postgres (CREATE DATABASE Mohamadhassan) it said database mohamadhassan already exists! WTF?😲😲
At least I found out that I should use quoted names in order not to let psql to lowercase it and it was successfully
done. 😊😊
The experience was about Installing postgresql 11.4 on windows 10 pro version 1903.

 [ "Zahra Ghaedi"]: Hello! this is about "ssl certificate error", I added a ssh key to my gitlab account by using gitlab documentation but
  when I tried to connect my pycharm project to gitlab I saw this error:ssl certificate error, I searched a lot and tried many wayes people suggested
  but they did not work. finally I used command below in my git bash and turn off sslverify :)))
  $ git config --global http.sslVerify false

  [ "Zahra Ghaedi"]:How to use multiple database in a django project???
  hi! to answer this question we have to know that what is the second database???
  You can read django document and use database routing but
  if you want to use mongoDB database with another databases such as postgreSql or Sqlite, the best offer is to use mongo-engine.
  first of all you have to download mongoDB from its website and install it then  add 'mongo' to your system  environment.if you want to have an authorization with username and password,
  use command below to create an admin:
  $ mongo admin
  > db.createUser({ user: "myadmin", pwd: "1234", roles: ["userAdminAnyDatabase"] })
  then run MongoDB Compass Community and click on new connection. Hostname is'localhost' and mongo use port number 27017 as default.
  from Authentication dropdown list choose Username/Password and enter username and password that you just created. Set a favorite name and dont change another settings. then click on connect.
  In your pycharm project terminal install mongo-engine with this command:
  $ pip install mongoengine
  then write these codes above your models.py:

  from mongoengine import *
  connect('tumblelog')

  then in your settings.py file write this:
  MONGODB_DATABASES = {
    'mongo': {
        'ENGINE': 'djongo',
        'NAME': 'localhost',
        'USER': 'myadmin',
        'PASSWORD': '1234',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': 27017,
    }
}
and add 'django_mongoengine' to your INSTALLED-APPS.
in your models.py the model that you want to work with mongoDB does not inherit from models.Model. it must inherits from Document.
for example:

class test_1(Document):
    author = StringField( max_length=255)

after makemigration command , migrate your app.
congratulations!!! everything is done!!!
